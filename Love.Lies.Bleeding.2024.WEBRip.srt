1
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,320
Lou-Lou!

2
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,257
Lou-Lou!

3
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,182
Lou-Lou!

4
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,022
- There you are.
- Hey, Daisy.

5
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,793
Looks like you've got
your hands full.

6
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:22,729
Yep!

7
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,642
- Hurray.
- Nice.

8
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,948
What's up, Daisy?

9
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,016
Was wondering if, um,
maybe you wanted

10
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,424
to meet up later?

11
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,492
Go to Winkie's.

12
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,120
Oh!

13
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:53,628
I gotta help Beth
with some stuff...

14
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,663
I got to help her.
It's boring.

15
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:58,996
Aw! Poor Lou-Lou.

16
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:01,999
Always looking out for her, sis.

17
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,672
You know, you gotta remember
your own needs too.

18
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,345
I have some stuff to finish
up here too though, so...

19
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,577
You've got time.

20
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,282
Hey, you should have
one on me tonight.

21
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,241
Oh, you don't...
You don't have to do that.

22
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:14,913
Why not? It's fine.

23
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:18,290
Have fun. Rain check.

24
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,424
But...

25
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,059
Hey, buddy.

26
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,712
<i>When you smoke a cigarette,</i>

27
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:21,012
<i>you inhale a drug
called nicotine.</i>

28
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:25,280
<i>You could replace
the word drug with poison.</i>

29
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:28,921
<i>Like anything that is not
built on solid foundations,</i>

30
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:31,088
<i>the brainwashing is as fragile</i>

31
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,958
<i>as a house of cards...</i>

32
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,058
<i>and will collapse</i>

33
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
<i>in an instant.</i>

34
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:38,568
<i>All you have to do is
give it a shake.</i>

35
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,907
Yeah, you like that dick?

36
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,172
Oh!

37
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,548
Oh, fuck!

38
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,550
Oh, fuck!

39
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:55,849
Oh, fuck!

40
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:05,925
Oh, that was...
that was magical.

41
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,599
Ah, fuck, yeah.

42
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,331
So... So should
I call you, or?

43
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,036
What?

44
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:20,709
- About the job?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

45
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,447
Yeah.

46
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,212
Swing by tomorrow.

47
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:35,658
Hey, careful where you sleep
around here.

48
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,286
It's dangerous.

49
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,353
Okay.

50
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:09,989
Ah!

51
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,684
<i>I'd describe the withdrawal</i>

52
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:37,115
<i>from nicotine as a mild, empty,</i>

53
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,689
<i>slightly insecure feeling.</i>

54
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,592
<i>I've also stated that
the only reason</i>

55
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,463
<i>a smoker lights up
is to relieve that feeling.</i>

56
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,565
<i>All smokers are caught up...</i>

57
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,797
<i>in the same trap.</i>

58
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:57,399
- Good morning.
- Hey.

59
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,203
Okay.

60
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,139
We're running a little late.
Nothing to worry about.

61
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,173
You'll never catch me!

62
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:03,405
Running too fast!

63
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:05,781
Whoa! You okay, bud?

64
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:06,881
Slow down.

65
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,444
- I lost a tooth, Lou.
- What?

66
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,589
Shucks, man.
You gotta be more careful.

67
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,854
Hey, Billy.
Quit hanging off her.

68
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:13,954
Come on, you guys.

69
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:15,120
Let's get all
our stuff together.

70
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,561
Aunt Lou's gonna
drive you to school.

71
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,694
Mom! He's calling me...

72
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,959
Can you open this?

73
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,422
Boys, come get your things.

74
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:22,897
- Mom!
- Come on, ready?

75
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,162
Okay.

76
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:26,428
- How's my makeup?
- Mom, he is cheating.

77
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,836
- Ready, set, go!
- I'm not.

78
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,035
You cheated last time.

79
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,575
Hey, Bethy Boopski?

80
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,841
- You girls goin' to the store?
- Why? You want something?

81
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:34,106
Can you grab me some smokes.

82
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:35,470
I'm just...
I don't wanna be late.

83
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:36,632
I don't think I'll have time.

84
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:38,979
Yeah, I could...
I can come...

85
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,310
- Yeah?
- Drop it off.

86
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,147
- There you go.
- Aren't we late? No!

87
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,786
Late for school?
Something like that?

88
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:44,754
Dad! Dad!

89
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,481
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

90
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,417
- Later, my dudes.
- Bye, Dad.

91
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:49,451
Bye!

92
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:50,859
- Mom!
- Mom!

93
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,422
I don't know where my bag is.

94
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:54,424
Where is it?

95
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,711
<i>Since</i> Die Hard<i> came out,</i>

96
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,373
fucking everyone wants
to try the Beretta.

97
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,914
We're, uh, we're setting up
a new indoor range out there.

98
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:16,082
How's it going, guys?

99
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,348
Uh, we got the beginners'
range out there...

100
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,053
We also got long distance,

101
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,550
moving target, novelty...

102
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,893
Get... Get a lot of tourists
come out for the day.

103
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,457
Fuckin' crazy-ass
foreigners mostly.

104
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,129
Uh, that's the canteen.

105
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:33,561
Sandwiches, drinks.
Get a little wild if you want.

106
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:35,003
All right, we're gonna
head this way.

107
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,137
Should I be nervous
or something?

108
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,974
No, just...
Just don't make me look

109
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,239
- like an asshole.
- Okay.

110
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,537
You know,
just stand up straight.

111
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,341
I'll do my best.

112
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:46,750
Oh, watch out for that.

113
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:49,687
Yeah.

114
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,350
Boss, now a good time?

115
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:54,956
Good as any.

116
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,666
Wow.
Cool. What is that?

117
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,866
One of my Hercules larvae.

118
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,395
Just giving his bed
a little spruce.

119
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,529
They like things moist and cozy.

120
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,003
Fuck, yeah. They do.

121
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,103
Yeah.

122
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,975
Oh, uh. This here is Jackie.

123
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,340
- Uh, this is Mr. Langston.
- Hi.

124
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:18,606
She needs a job.
Says she'll do anything.

125
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,718
I figured we could use
some spare hands.

126
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,851
Yeah, you like guns?

127
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:23,721
Not really.

128
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,053
What the fuck are
you doing here then?

129
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:27,120
Anyone can feel strong

130
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,362
hiding behind a piece of metal.

131
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,761
I prefer to know
my own strength.

132
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:32,796
Is that right?

133
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:49,945
Excuse me,
the end toilet is blocked.

134
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,243
It's overflowing.

135
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,609
Excuse me?

136
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,820
- The end toilet is blocked.
- Then use the other one.

137
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,686
Can I get a Mountain Dew?

138
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,526
Hey!

139
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,495
- The machine's over there.
- It's broken.

140
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:51,369
There you go.

141
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,976
You're Lou Langston's daughter.

142
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,011
- So?
- He's an old friend of mine.

143
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,639
How is your old man?

144
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,015
My old man?

145
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:02,545
He's a piece of shit.
We don't talk.

146
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,712
Pretty sure
his friends know that.

147
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:07,220
And your mom, do you know
where I could find her?

148
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:12,863
- Why?
- Just to talk.

149
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, I'll tell you what.

150
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,772
When you're feeling
more friendly, give us a call.

151
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,884
You're nice.
Can we talk?

152
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:36,986
- I'm Jackie.
- Jackie.

153
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,416
Closing.

154
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,352
Whoa!
We're still in here.

155
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:42,222
We're closed, fuck off.

156
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:44,994
Jackie.

157
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,126
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:19,897
Can I steal one?

159
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah.

160
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,184
Is this your place?

161
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,857
No, I just work here.

162
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,486
Okay.

163
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:54,841
You were looking
pretty good in there.

164
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,759
Yeah?

165
00:13:57,761 --> 00:14:00,267
You got some
pretty serious lines going.

166
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,973
Jackie!

167
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,843
There you are.

168
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,945
Ladies.

169
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,409
If that's all right
with you, Lou?

170
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,378
Hey, we're gonna go
grab a drink right now

171
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,677
- if you wanna come with us?
- Thanks. I'm good here.

172
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:17,922
Babe.

173
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,682
You know, Lou here is
a grade A dyke, right?

174
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:21,519
Is that so?

175
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:24,687
Funny, come on.

176
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,898
Touch me...

177
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,295
Whoa! Ay!

178
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,758
- Whoa, man. She's a girl.
- Hey, hey, hey!

179
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,166
- I'm sorry about that.
- You crazy bitch.

180
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,827
- Yeah, here we... Come on, now.
- I was being nice.

181
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,368
- Fuck you!
- Fuck him! Let's go.

182
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,380
You cooling off out here?

183
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,514
You wanna ice yourself?

184
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:52,022
You gotta be careful
around here, I'm telling you.

185
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,122
That could've gotten
a lot worse.

186
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,156
I could take him.

187
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,422
Oh... Sorry.

188
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,063
So where did you appear from?

189
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,858
- Oklahoma.
- Really?

190
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,367
Yeah, I've been
hitchhiking for a while now.

191
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:09,402
Are you heading
anywhere particular?

192
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:16,475
So there's finals
for this bodybuilding contest

193
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,740
next month in Vegas.

194
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:20,149
Um... Gonna give it
a shot.

195
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,745
I'm just laying low here
while I train.

196
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,318
Cool.

197
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:26,914
Um, most times
when people hear that,

198
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,257
I get this look like...

199
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,358
Yeah, I think I know that look.

200
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,459
Is that why you left home?

201
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,527
Oklahomans not
into muscle chicks?

202
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,859
Yeah, not so much.

203
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:40,400
The place I'm from,
everyone's a farmer,

204
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,765
goes to church twice a week,
that kind of thing.

205
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,835
So how does
an Oklahoma farm girl

206
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:48,375
get into bodybuilding.

207
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:52,643
Uh, my folks adopted me
when I was 13.

208
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:55,085
And I was a fat kid.

209
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,944
So, kind of got bullied a lot.

210
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,550
- Shit.
- No, it's good.

211
00:15:58,552 --> 00:15:59,782
Taught me to fight back.

212
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:01,883
Mmm.

213
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:06,723
So you're gonna win
this competition.

214
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,461
- And then what?
- I don't know.

215
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,497
I didn't think
that far ahead yet.

216
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,171
Yeah, I think I know that one.

217
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,737
You want me
to show you something?

218
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:25,478
- Okay.
- You have to stay here.

219
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:29,812
I'll be back.

220
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:42,165
So maybe this is dumb.
I don't know, I mean...

221
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,926
You're probably
all set with these.

222
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,468
But, ta-da!

223
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,673
Are these yours?

224
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,543
Yeah. How am I doing?

225
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,545
Hmm?

226
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,779
Thanks, but I...
I can't afford them.

227
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,716
I mean, they're free.

228
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:06,948
The guys here order 'em in bulk

229
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,455
from, like, Germany or Romania.

230
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,886
They're fucking everywhere.
I'll just give them to you.

231
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:13,559
Do you not do this shit?

232
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:15,429
Uh...

233
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,465
Au naturelle, baby.

234
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:21,237
All right.
Your body, your choice.

235
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,242
You wanna do a little bit?

236
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:33,645
I think 150 is, kind of,
the smallest dose you can do

237
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:36,483
and if you have four weeks,

238
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,650
you'll barely notice it,
but it'll build up gradually

239
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:41,917
and just give you that
little... edge.

240
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,194
Where do you want it?

241
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,022
In the butt.

242
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:49,859
Then turn around.

243
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,926
Fuck.

244
00:17:57,902 --> 00:18:00,705
- Okay.
- Okay, incoming.

245
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:01,739
Mmm.

246
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:06,546
Done.

247
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,813
How does it feel?

248
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,653
Feel it already?
You're, like, boom, boom!

249
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,920
It's all over it immediately.
Like Popeye eating spinach.

250
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,196
So stupid.

251
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,476
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

252
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,776
You're not, like, some fucking
straight girl, right?

253
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,976
Just trying shit out?

254
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,083
Ow!

255
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,161
Oh, shit, sorry.

256
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:04,142
Holy, shit!

257
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:23,986
Holy, fuck.

258
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:57,756
Hey!

259
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,331
Hey.

260
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,932
So I gotta...
I gotta go to work today,

261
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,638
but do you, maybe,
wanna hang out later?

262
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,574
You got a job already?

263
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,169
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm waitressing

264
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:17,545
at this shooting range place
just outside of town.

265
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:20,284
It's like, ton of gun nuts
and weirdos.

266
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,516
Pay's pretty good though.

267
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,422
Oh, man don't work there.

268
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:30,327
- Why not?
- My dad runs it.

269
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,121
Oh my, God.
I met him yesterday.

270
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,057
- Fun.
- Wait. The bug guy?

271
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,795
Yeah, the bug guy.

272
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,933
So where are you staying?

273
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:45,870
Um, I'm actually not sure yet.

274
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,972
What does that mean?

275
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:50,578
I was gonna ask
if maybe I could...

276
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,780
crash here couple of nights.

277
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:57,321
I mean, like, until
I get paid, you know, like...

278
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,883
Until I can afford
a room somewhere.

279
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:06,594
You can stay here.

280
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,024
I can just sleep on the couch.

281
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:09,927
No, shut the fuck up.
You can stay here.

282
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,265
- This is delicious.
- Good.

283
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:20,641
I mean, like, you know,
next time, maybe,

284
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:23,270
- take the yolks out, but...
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:24,480
Mmm-hmm.

286
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:27,978
Okay.

287
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,839
And then we do our first pose,

288
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,643
which is a double front bicep.

289
00:21:55,645 --> 00:22:00,076
Super strong,
and confident, relaxed, right?

290
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,020
<i>Why don't you want me
working for your dad?</i>

291
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,593
<i>We just don't get along.</i>

292
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,464
<i>How come?
'Cause you like girls?</i>

293
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,927
No, he didn't care about that.

294
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:57,534
That's cool of him.

295
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,097
He's not cool.
He's a fucking psycho.

296
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:41,578
What about your mom?

297
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:44,471
What?

298
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,440
She's gone...
She's... It's, um...

299
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:49,278
It's been, like, 12 years.

300
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,787
You mean she's dead?

301
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,184
No, she's gone.

302
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:00,925
What's wrong?
Why are you stopping?

303
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,831
Come on, let's go.

304
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,767
Come on.

305
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,131
Up, up, up, up.

306
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,134
God, fuck!

307
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:13,005
Oh, Lou, ew.

308
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,548
Ah! Hmm.

309
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,014
I can get a job
somewhere else if you want.

310
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:25,380
Do what you want.

311
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:49,679
That's not what
I'm paying you for.

312
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:52,242
I'm on my break, sir.

313
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,443
Come on.

314
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,481
Come on!

315
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:06,322
<i>If you work here, you should
at least know the basics.</i>

316
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,867
Line her up.

317
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:19,203
You only have
to be very, very gentle.

318
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,381
A bit more powerful
than a punch, huh?

319
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:37,826
One more time, line it up.

320
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,092
- Okay.
- That's it. Nice and easy.

321
00:26:54,878 --> 00:26:56,405
Will you come with me to Vegas?

322
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,815
I want you to see me win.

323
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,817
Yeah.

324
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,050
Yeah, of course.

325
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,791
But, you know,
if you don't win, that's okay.

326
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,826
Right?

327
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,901
Jesus.

328
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,975
Afterwards, let's
just keep driving.

329
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,648
Where?

330
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:32,980
California.

331
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:37,281
Yeah, if I win.
I can get a job as a trainer,

332
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:41,791
find a place by the beach,
swim in the ocean.

333
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,024
All that stuff.

334
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:48,798
Yeah, I've never been
anywhere but here.

335
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:53,671
Why not?

336
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:35,669
So, is the, um...
When is the contest?

337
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,309
- This Thursday.
- Mmm.

338
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:40,883
How are you feeling?

339
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,214
Mmm. Good, I think.

340
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:43,512
She's gonna knock 'em out.

341
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,415
Yeah, you look amazing.

342
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,824
Ooh, food.

343
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:50,189
Thanks.

344
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:53,896
- More?
- Yeah.

345
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,997
- Pineapple?
- No.

346
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,835
You guys
will love Vegas. It's wild.

347
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,034
I've heard.
Have you gone?

348
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:01,805
We went
for our honeymoon, actually.

349
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,038
Stupid...
Fucking things.

350
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,974
- You need help, hon?
- No, it's fine.

351
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:08,042
- You need a fork?
- No.

352
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:12,739
- Just hold...
- I got it.

353
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:15,016
I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

354
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:16,215
- That's gonna stain.
- I know, I know.

355
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,480
What... What are you...
You can't just

356
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,202
rub my dick in the middle
of the restaurant.

357
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,322
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,562
Please don't.

359
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,312
What the fuck?

360
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:49,479
If you touch her
one more time...

361
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:53,219
What? What is it, Lou?

362
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:55,254
It'll be the last
fucking thing you do.

363
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:56,959
What the fuck did she tell you
this time, huh?

364
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,796
She doesn't have
to tell me shit. I have eyes.

365
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,689
Why don't you look closer

366
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:03,229
at your new girlfriend,
then, huh?

367
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:05,271
Instead of interfering in shit
you don't know about.

368
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,466
Yeah. Yeah, I met her

369
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:11,072
first night
she rocked up into town.

370
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,470
Took her out back of Daggers.

371
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:15,670
Gave it to her right there
in the parking lot.

372
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:18,145
She wanted that job
so fucking bad.

373
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:20,114
Let me tell you.

374
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,985
Although, I guess...
not as bad as she wanted

375
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,855
a free fucking
gym membership, huh?

376
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,179
Are you gonna be like
this the rest of the night?

377
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:56,986
Want me to drop you
off somewhere?

378
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,053
Drop me off?

379
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:02,288
JJ's?

380
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,158
Fuck, I knew that's why
you're being so weird.

381
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,687
Babe.

382
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,130
You fucked him.

383
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,937
I didn't know
who he was or anything.

384
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,466
I hadn't even met you yet.

385
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:17,072
I met you the day
after you got here.

386
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:18,601
So what? Fuck.

387
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:20,911
So you'd fuck guys?

388
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,704
I specifically asked you...

389
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:23,881
I like both.

390
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,051
I guess it doesn't
really matter who it is,

391
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,053
as long as they
hook you up with a job,

392
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,319
or a place to stay,

393
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,453
take out your egg yolks.

394
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,292
Did I get it?

395
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,198
Fuck you.

396
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,331
Yeah?

397
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,336
Hey, where
the fuck are you going?

398
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:53,174
- Where does it look like?
- Nowhere.

399
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:55,704
How could you fuck
that guy, baby?

400
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,674
Did you enjoy it?

401
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,413
'Cause he's
beyond sickening like...

402
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:03,448
Like, a fucking scumbag.

403
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,879
He beats the crap
out of Beth, Jack.

404
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:07,056
She's completely brainwashed.

405
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,519
She's the only reason
I stick around.

406
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:13,128
But maybe you think that
I don't have an actual life

407
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,097
outside of helping you
with your dumb shit.

408
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,165
Fuck you!

409
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,233
Of course, I do. But you don't
tell me anything.

410
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:21,301
I'm telling you now.

411
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:24,535
Look, look...
That's what's going on.

412
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:26,207
That's what's always
been going on.

413
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,274
The cops don't do anything

414
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:28,506
because she won't press charges.

415
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:30,046
I don't know
what the fuck to do.

416
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,806
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't...

417
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:33,313
share that with you.

418
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:37,779
You don't think
I have horror stories, Lou.

419
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,418
Huh? I got plenty.

420
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,192
You don't...
You don't understand.

421
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,823
This guy, I wanna...

422
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:51,463
I wanna do really...

423
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,169
I wanna do really bad...

424
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:55,896
I... I wanna fuckin' kill him.

425
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,642
Get back in the car.

426
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,788
Close the door, come on.

427
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:55,362
Just give me a second.

428
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:14,513
I thought you quit.

429
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,682
This doesn't count.

430
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:21,553
I'm wanna stretch you.

431
00:34:23,722 --> 00:34:25,194
I wanna see how far you can go.

432
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,525
Do you put your fingers
inside when you fuck yourself?

433
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:41,837
How do you do it?

434
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,004
You wanna show me?

435
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:48,745
Come on, show me.

436
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,489
Is that really how you do it?

437
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,805
Good girl.

438
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:26,552
Oh, shit.

439
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,339
I love you.

440
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:47,936
I love you, too.

441
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,624
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

442
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:09,958
Yeah.

443
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,370
Hey, is... Okay, this is 08?

444
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:23,477
Oh!

445
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:28,449
Hey.

446
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,520
Oh, my God.

447
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:42,364
Paramedics picked
her up at 3:00 a.m.

448
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,827
Still waiting for her
to come round.

449
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,863
I'm not sure.
Sometime late last night.

450
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,370
Where the fuck is he?

451
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,602
If you're referring
to the husband

452
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,340
he's at the station
giving a statement.

453
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,506
A statement?

454
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:54,937
We're clear. We know.
He did this.

455
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:57,544
Ma'am, no one knows
exactly what happened.

456
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:58,974
Have you seen her?

457
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:00,646
We're gonna wait
until your sister wakes up

458
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:03,286
and then we're gonna ask
if she wants to press charges.

459
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,780
I'll make sure she gets
everything she needs.

460
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:42,556
It's best we take care
of JJ ourselves.

461
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,691
He'll regret this.

462
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:46,956
That's what you said last time.

463
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:49,596
She wouldn't wanna wake up

464
00:37:49,598 --> 00:37:51,400
and find her husband in jail.

465
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,161
I wasn't thinking about jail.

466
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:57,373
She wouldn't
want him dead either.

467
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:01,674
I'd like to respect her wishes.

468
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:04,941
That's big of you.

469
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:22,255
Don't worry, little Bethany.

470
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,768
It's all gonna heal.

471
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:00,370
I'm sorry, Lou.

472
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:06,838
Fuck!

473
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,810
Ah! God, ah!

474
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,223
<i>JJ, we gotta talk.</i>

475
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,359
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

476
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:21,880
Hello?

477
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:52,075
Shut the fuck up!

478
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:55,617
What the...

479
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,315
No, no, no, no!

480
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:03,350
No! I'm sorry.

481
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:25,977
Come on.

482
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,517
Nothing more you can do here.

483
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,335
<i>This is crack cocaine,</i>

484
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:58,372
<i>seized a few days ago
by drug enforcement agents</i>

485
00:41:58,374 --> 00:42:01,518
<i>in a park just across
the street from the mine.</i>

486
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:03,652
Stop! Stop!

487
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:06,347
<i>Could easily
have been heroin or PCP.</i>

488
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,257
Oh!

489
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,031
Oh!

490
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:57,673
Jack.

491
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:10,048
Jack, are you okay?

492
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,379
Baby, are you okay?

493
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:13,546
Hmm?

494
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:18,925
Jackie?

495
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:20,553
Baby, what the fuck happened?

496
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,358
I made it right.

497
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:31,564
Oh, they're gonna
fucking fry you for this!

498
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:35,271
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

499
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,474
What? Did anyone...

500
00:43:41,378 --> 00:43:42,410
Did anybody see you?

501
00:43:45,888 --> 00:43:46,953
Okay.

502
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,672
Fuck.

503
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,125
He's not gonna fit. I think...
I think we have to...

504
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:29,127
Let's... Let's unroll him.

505
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:31,195
Just push.

506
00:44:31,197 --> 00:44:32,295
Okay.

507
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:43,603
All right. We're just
gonna go for a drive, okay?

508
00:44:45,915 --> 00:44:47,211
I know a place.

509
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,447
Baby, go get my truck.

510
00:44:53,153 --> 00:44:55,219
Follow me, okay?

511
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,128
Nope.

512
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:38,064
Lou-Lou.

513
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:39,835
Roll your window down.

514
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,772
Come on it's red, please.

515
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,536
- Hey, stranger.
- Daisy.

516
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,077
- New ride?
- No. I mean, yeah.

517
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,309
How you doing?

518
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:56,082
I'm good.
Thank you for asking.

519
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:58,513
Um, so what are you doing
out so late, huh?

520
00:45:58,515 --> 00:46:00,020
Just driving,
'cause I have a headache

521
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:02,220
- and it's a migraine.
- Poor, Lou-Lou.

522
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:05,927
Ugh! Smelly cunt...
Drive around!

523
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,159
Hey.

524
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:08,556
Ain't... Ain't that
your truck?

525
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,261
Actually, I gotta go right now,

526
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:12,362
but we should go to Winkie's.

527
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:13,660
- Are you around tomorrow?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

528
00:46:13,662 --> 00:46:14,870
- Sounds fun. I love it.
- Okay.

529
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,552
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

530
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:20,963
Lou? Are you sure?

531
00:48:24,892 --> 00:48:26,133
Trust me.

532
00:48:41,348 --> 00:48:42,545
What is this place?

533
00:48:52,854 --> 00:48:54,392
Hey, don't worry, Jack.

534
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:56,889
We're gonna be okay.

535
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:00,035
You just gotta listen
to me, okay?

536
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,201
You gotta do what I say.

537
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,476
So, I'm gonna go back to Beth's

538
00:49:12,478 --> 00:49:14,577
to make sure
we didn't leave anything.

539
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:15,842
I think you should stay here.

540
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:19,846
Why don't you pack now?
And I'll come with you.

541
00:49:19,848 --> 00:49:21,650
We could make it
to Vegas by the evening.

542
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:28,195
No, we can't go anywhere now.

543
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,136
Why not?

544
00:49:36,271 --> 00:49:37,336
It's, um...

545
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:39,767
Hey, come here.

546
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:41,835
Come here. Come here.

547
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,606
Listen to me.

548
00:49:45,313 --> 00:49:49,480
Someone's gonna see
that smoke. Like any minute.

549
00:49:49,482 --> 00:49:51,218
And then the cops are gonna
find JJ's body.

550
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:54,617
It's okay. That's good.

551
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,322
'Cause there's
other shit down there.

552
00:49:57,886 --> 00:49:59,589
There's other shit down there

553
00:49:59,591 --> 00:50:02,097
that's gonna lead them
to someone else.

554
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,329
There's shit down there
that someone else

555
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:04,462
is gonna have to answer for.

556
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,958
Not you.

557
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:07,828
I have to go.

558
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,302
No, no, no, no. We have to...

559
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:10,930
- The competition's tomorrow.
- No, we have to stay here,

560
00:50:10,932 --> 00:50:13,669
lay low and act real normal.

561
00:50:13,671 --> 00:50:15,077
I was always gonna go.

562
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:17,739
You said you'd come with me.

563
00:50:21,008 --> 00:50:22,645
Beth's safe now.

564
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:25,945
Okay.

565
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,189
Uh...

566
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:30,389
Can we talk about this later?

567
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:33,986
I love you.

568
00:50:35,528 --> 00:50:36,725
Please stay here.

569
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,036
<i>This is
history in the making, folks.</i>

570
00:51:57,038 --> 00:51:59,940
<i>The German government
said tonight they'll be making</i>

571
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:02,514
<i>at least a dozen
more openings in the wall,</i>

572
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:05,385
<i>so that more people can
cross to the West.</i>

573
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:07,849
<i>The excitement
in the air is palpable.</i>

574
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:09,455
<i>The atmosphere is electric.</i>

575
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:12,293
<i>A celebration of the individual.</i>

576
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:20,928
Ah!

577
00:52:50,696 --> 00:52:52,993
JJ!

578
00:53:01,476 --> 00:53:03,212
JJ, you here?

579
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,610
We gotta talk, buddy.

580
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:10,142
Serge.

581
00:53:11,585 --> 00:53:14,223
Jeez. When's the last time
anyone took care of you?

582
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:16,654
Damn.

583
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,261
See anything?

584
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,329
Nothing.

585
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:08,475
He's not here, guys.
Let's go.

586
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:10,279
Yeah, his car's gone.

587
00:55:13,905 --> 00:55:15,410
Jackie?

588
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:22,582
Jack.

589
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:30,650
You didn't know anything?

590
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:33,521
Please.
Do they even know it's JJ?

591
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,347
Licence plates match.

592
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:37,019
My buddy said
it will be 24 hours,

593
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:39,857
before they can get
down there and ID the body.

594
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:41,793
- You sure it wasn't suicide?
- No.

595
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:43,564
Cars don't explode like that
when they crash.

596
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,598
Just in the movies.

597
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:47,865
With Beth in the hospital,

598
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,147
they're gonna be looking at you.

599
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:52,639
Who else knows about that place?

600
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:55,268
What do I pay you for?

601
00:56:56,645 --> 00:56:57,809
Find out.

602
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:13,528
Ah, fucking...

603
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:16,927
Whoo! Ah!

604
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:23,362
Whoo! Oh.

605
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:24,737
Hey baby, Lou, come on.

606
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:26,706
Pack your bags, let's go!

607
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,510
I'm so fucking ready! Ah!

608
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:35,550
Pack your bags.
We gotta go.

609
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:37,409
Mmm, God.

610
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:39,378
Jesus fucking Christ, Jack.

611
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,522
Where have you been?

612
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,626
I asked for one thing.

613
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,452
I asked you to do one thing.
I said stay home

614
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:48,574
while I sort out everything!

615
00:57:49,698 --> 00:57:51,533
How much of that stuff
did you take?

616
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,260
- You didn't ask.
- What?

617
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,965
- You locked me in!
- Hey, whoa!

618
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:58,265
Jack?

619
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:03,303
It's okay.

620
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:08,550
It's okay.

621
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,752
Come here.

622
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:17,757
You killed a man, Jack.
Did you get that?

623
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:19,561
Yeah. Yeah, you're welcome.

624
00:58:21,257 --> 00:58:23,323
- You're fucking crazy.
- Fuck you!

625
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:24,929
Fuck you!

626
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:26,161
This isn't a game, Jack.

627
00:58:26,163 --> 00:58:27,998
We need to be
so fucking careful right now.

628
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,999
Forget about Vegas.

629
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,935
Ow! Ah!

630
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,550
Sorry, baby.

631
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:44,443
Wish me luck.

632
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,445
What?

633
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:56,422
Hey!

634
00:59:02,298 --> 00:59:04,364
- Where you headin'?
- Vegas!

635
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:06,806
Guess it's your lucky day.

636
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,893
Good morning, sunshine.

637
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,292
It's your stop, right?

638
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,935
Oh!

639
01:00:09,937 --> 01:00:11,739
Oh, good job, kiddo.

640
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,973
Good job.

641
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,535
Hey...

642
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,945
Come here, Bobby.
Mom's just a bit sad.

643
01:00:19,947 --> 01:00:22,277
Has he called?
Has anyone heard from him?

644
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:24,312
Not yet, honey.

645
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:28,987
Lou, did you talk to him?

646
01:00:30,254 --> 01:00:31,319
Did you tell him to leave?

647
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:33,024
No, no.

648
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:36,995
You promise me?

649
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,064
Beth, I... Yeah.

650
01:00:40,935 --> 01:00:42,264
He'll be back, honey.

651
01:00:43,597 --> 01:00:46,433
This guy has
a lot of thinking to do.

652
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,780
I'll grab a soda.

653
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:21,941
You going to ignore me
the rest of your life?

654
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:24,878
This isn't about you or me.
This is about Beth.

655
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,541
She's the only fucking reason
that I'm here, Dad.

656
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:30,950
I admire how protective
you are of your sister,

657
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:32,545
but maybe next time you might be

658
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,087
a little more careful
how you go about it.

659
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:42,929
- What are you talking about?
- They found JJ in his car.

660
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:46,328
Yeah. Mike filled me in
on the details.

661
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,835
What they know so far.

662
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,628
Great. I'm glad Mike's doing
some actual law enforcement

663
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,805
for a change.

664
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:53,500
Someone burnt it up pretty bad.

665
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:56,811
Maybe they didn't know
the smoke could be seen

666
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,813
for miles.

667
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,881
An innocent act of stupidity,

668
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,544
or maybe there's something
you wanna tell me.

669
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,648
Here she is, officers.

670
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:17,865
No!

671
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:22,034
No! No!

672
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:23,871
I wanna see him.

673
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:28,667
I wanna see him!

674
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,310
What's it like down there?

675
01:02:36,017 --> 01:02:38,248
It keeps going down!

676
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,316
The car is just wedged here.

677
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,550
I'm going down
for a better look.

678
01:02:51,296 --> 01:02:52,625
You see anything?

679
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:59,368
Fuck! There's more.

680
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:18,612
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

681
01:04:18,614 --> 01:04:21,923
<i>your attention please,
competitors 20 to 25,</i>

682
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:24,024
<i>stand on the stage, please.</i>

683
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,894
<i>Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

684
01:04:40,075 --> 01:04:41,305
<i>And now...</i>

685
01:04:41,307 --> 01:04:45,177
<i>It's the ladies!</i>

686
01:05:01,294 --> 01:05:02,656
<i>Quarter turn to the right.</i>

687
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:19,046
<i>Quarter turn to the right.</i>

688
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:27,219
<i>Face the front.</i>

689
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:42,234
<i>Thank you.</i>

690
01:05:45,932 --> 01:05:47,767
<i>Beautiful, aren't they?</i>

691
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:50,077
<i>And we're just getting started.</i>

692
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,936
<i>Each competitor will
return to the stage</i>

693
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:53,839
<i>for their individual routine.</i>

694
01:06:05,457 --> 01:06:06,621
Jackie!

695
01:06:08,361 --> 01:06:10,130
Fuckin' get it.

696
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:17,137
<i>Up first,
all the way from Oklahoma,</i>

697
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,469
<i>Miss Jaqueline Cleaver!</i>

698
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,856
Baby, I told you to lay low.

699
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:55,235
Fucking fatty.

700
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,567
Did fatty eat too much?

701
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,835
<i>Security to the stage.</i>

702
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,477
Knock it off!

703
01:08:06,479 --> 01:08:07,940
- Stop!
- Uh! Come on!

704
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,022
I was waiting
for you at Winkie's last night.

705
01:08:24,357 --> 01:08:25,892
Oh, yeah?

706
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:27,993
Sorry, I was, uh,
with my sister.

707
01:08:27,995 --> 01:08:29,599
She's, you know,
in the hospital.

708
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:30,765
It's been a whole thing.

709
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:32,096
Oh, yeah.

710
01:08:32,098 --> 01:08:34,241
I... I... I heard about
what happened to B.

711
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:37,640
Actually, I, um...

712
01:08:37,642 --> 01:08:41,006
I brought you
a little something.

713
01:08:41,008 --> 01:08:44,680
It's just a little something
to... to cheer you up.

714
01:08:44,682 --> 01:08:47,188
I can't imagine how
you must be feeling right.

715
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:52,820
That's nice.

716
01:08:55,891 --> 01:08:58,958
Um, you know, I... I quit.

717
01:08:59,895 --> 01:09:01,059
All of it.

718
01:09:01,061 --> 01:09:03,567
Oh, my gosh. Lou-Lou!

719
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,404
Do... Do you want me to stop?

720
01:09:05,406 --> 01:09:06,702
No, but I just don't need this.

721
01:09:06,704 --> 01:09:07,868
You should keep it.

722
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:11,344
No, save it.

723
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:13,445
For an emergency.

724
01:09:21,653 --> 01:09:23,521
Sure was weird seeing you
the other night.

725
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:27,723
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

726
01:09:27,725 --> 01:09:29,461
Yeah. I was even
thinking about you

727
01:09:29,463 --> 01:09:32,024
as I was walking along there.

728
01:09:32,026 --> 01:09:34,928
I don't know why. It's just
a crazy coincidence, I guess.

729
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,336
- Crazy.
- Mmm-hmm.

730
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:37,997
Or fate.

731
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:44,608
I did wanna ask you
one thing, though,

732
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:46,775
and I understand if maybe
it's none of my business.

733
01:09:48,009 --> 01:09:51,318
No, please. What?

734
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,518
What was she doing
driving your truck?

735
01:09:56,853 --> 01:09:57,885
Who?

736
01:09:58,822 --> 01:09:59,986
You know,

737
01:10:00,758 --> 01:10:03,055
that big girl.

738
01:10:03,057 --> 01:10:05,057
Thought you two were,
maybe, together or something.

739
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:07,829
I... I... I...

740
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:09,534
I'm not with her.

741
01:10:09,536 --> 01:10:11,470
It's, like, she's
somebody that I...

742
01:10:12,473 --> 01:10:14,308
I haven't seen her in a while.

743
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:17,641
Oh, yeah?

744
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:20,743
Yeah, it's a weird coincidence
that she was behind me.

745
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:23,680
Yeah, I thought
it was weird, too.

746
01:10:24,848 --> 01:10:26,848
And that
you were driving JJ's car.

747
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,424
We hung out a couple of times.

748
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:34,185
I never forget a Camaro.

749
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:57,813
Court appearance is
in eight days.

750
01:10:57,815 --> 01:10:59,419
Bail is set at $300.

751
01:11:01,753 --> 01:11:03,049
You get one phone call.

752
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,277
<i>Lou's residence. Howdy.</i>

753
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:24,642
Who's this?

754
01:11:24,644 --> 01:11:28,316
Stay away from her.
She doesn't want you anymore.

755
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:54,001
All right, Rambo.
Your guardian angel's here.

756
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,311
You and Lou fall out
or something?

757
01:12:07,313 --> 01:12:08,587
That why you called me?

758
01:12:11,559 --> 01:12:15,088
Don't worry.
You made the right call.

759
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,991
My guys will take care
of this whole problem.

760
01:12:18,896 --> 01:12:23,261
You know, Lou and I have had
our share of arguments too.

761
01:12:23,263 --> 01:12:26,341
I bet she's told you
all kinds of things about me.

762
01:12:27,938 --> 01:12:29,333
That's her right.

763
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:32,446
Although, I find it
a little rich at times.

764
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:35,647
I own the gym.

765
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:37,044
She probably didn't
tell you that.

766
01:12:39,081 --> 01:12:40,619
I know you didn't ask
for my advice,

767
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:42,247
but seeing how you're
sitting in my car,

768
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:43,853
I get to tell you anyway...

769
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:46,988
You can't go
around killin' people

770
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:49,353
without figuring out
a few of the details first,

771
01:12:49,355 --> 01:12:50,563
you know what I mean?

772
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:52,400
Um, I wanna get out now, please.

773
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,732
I wanna get out.

774
01:12:58,331 --> 01:13:00,507
All right, get out
if you want to.

775
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,036
What do you think this is?

776
01:13:02,038 --> 01:13:03,334
But once you're out of this car,

777
01:13:03,336 --> 01:13:05,842
you're on your own.
You know that, don't you?

778
01:13:06,977 --> 01:13:08,944
I mean, really alone.

779
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:15,148
They found the body, the cops.

780
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:18,184
They're gonna ask questions.

781
01:13:20,694 --> 01:13:22,892
You really don't think
I have anything better to do?

782
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,830
Hmm? I came out here
to help you.

783
01:13:28,328 --> 01:13:29,437
Both of you.

784
01:13:31,364 --> 01:13:32,836
You know, Lou won't
ask me for it.

785
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:34,200
She thinks she has
it all under control,

786
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:35,971
but she can't handle
a thing like this.

787
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:39,810
You're smarter than that.
I know you are.

788
01:13:39,812 --> 01:13:41,108
Lou didn't do anything.

789
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:44,980
Why don't you close the door?

790
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,411
It's cold out there.

791
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:26,791
Call me when it's done.

792
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,355
You try and get some sleep now.

793
01:14:44,976 --> 01:14:46,074
Thank you.

794
01:14:49,783 --> 01:14:51,882
Ooh!

795
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:53,147
You sure you're not hungry?

796
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:55,479
Yeah, I... I just wanna be
boring for a second.

797
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:56,920
- And, uh...
- What is it?

798
01:14:56,922 --> 01:14:59,989
I just wanna clear the air
on this whole JJ thing.

799
01:14:59,991 --> 01:15:01,958
Well, he really had it coming,
didn't he?

800
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,895
Well, I mean, we weren't
friends or anything,

801
01:15:04,897 --> 01:15:05,929
but it's pretty horrible.

802
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:07,260
What happened to him, you know?

803
01:15:07,262 --> 01:15:08,701
I thought you were saying
how much you hated him.

804
01:15:08,703 --> 01:15:10,868
Yeah, but I didn't
want him dead.

805
01:15:12,069 --> 01:15:13,167
He was family.

806
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:15,466
Okay.

807
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,942
You know how we ran
into each other

808
01:15:18,944 --> 01:15:20,372
at the lights the other night?

809
01:15:20,374 --> 01:15:21,549
Mmm-hmm.

810
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:24,056
Did you tell anyone about that?

811
01:15:26,413 --> 01:15:27,786
Like the cops or anyone?

812
01:15:32,056 --> 01:15:33,858
I was thinking about it.

813
01:15:35,796 --> 01:15:38,192
What were you thinking
of saying?

814
01:15:40,295 --> 01:15:42,702
I thought they ought to know

815
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,497
that I saw that beefy girl
driving JJ's car that night.

816
01:15:48,303 --> 01:15:49,808
But you didn't
'cause she wasn't.

817
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,238
- Wasn't she?
- No.

818
01:15:54,078 --> 01:15:57,211
Sorry, I... I thought
you'd be pleased.

819
01:15:57,213 --> 01:15:59,048
You said you weren't
together anymore.

820
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,545
- No, we're... we're not.
- That why you brought me here?

821
01:16:01,547 --> 01:16:03,085
No, no. Hey.

822
01:16:03,087 --> 01:16:04,889
I'm just...

823
01:16:04,891 --> 01:16:07,419
Hey, I'm... I'm just looking
out for myself, you know.

824
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,258
Think about it,
if you tell the cops that

825
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,557
you saw her driving JJ's car,

826
01:16:13,559 --> 01:16:15,460
they're gonna start
asking around.

827
01:16:15,462 --> 01:16:17,033
They're gonna find out
we were dating,

828
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:18,298
that... that she was
staying with me.

829
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,739
And... And it would be
a whole thing.

830
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,202
And I don't wanna
get dragged into it,

831
01:16:21,204 --> 01:16:23,644
because I'm...
I'm scared, Daze.

832
01:16:25,175 --> 01:16:27,373
Oh...

833
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:31,377
My God, Lou-Lou,
I'm... I'm such a dum-dum.

834
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,686
I didn't think of that.

835
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,886
Hey, it's okay.
You were just trying to help.

836
01:16:34,888 --> 01:16:36,547
Mmm-hmm.
I appreciate it.

837
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,583
Don't talk to anyone.

838
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:40,661
Especially the cops, okay?

839
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:41,794
- 'Cause...
- Okay.

840
01:16:41,796 --> 01:16:43,191
I actually don't even know

841
01:16:43,193 --> 01:16:45,424
anything about what happened
to JJ that night.

842
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:48,097
He got smashed in the head
and set on fire, apparently.

843
01:16:50,101 --> 01:16:52,431
Okay, so if anyone asks you,

844
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:54,499
you didn't see Jackie,
anywhere that night, right?

845
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,271
Must've been some other freak.

846
01:16:57,273 --> 01:16:58,943
Exactly.

847
01:17:07,283 --> 01:17:08,414
Thanks, Daisy.

848
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:13,628
God, I'm fucking starving now.

849
01:17:14,356 --> 01:17:15,421
All right!

850
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:17,324
Oh, let's order margaritas.

851
01:17:17,326 --> 01:17:19,898
- All right.
- Excuse me.

852
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,742
So you're just getting
your things right?

853
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,106
Gotta go pick up Beth.

854
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,011
Hey, look. Hey, look.

855
01:17:34,013 --> 01:17:35,815
Need to go
to the hospital, okay?

856
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:54,097
I'm... I'm... Baby.
I'm not... This isn't...

857
01:17:54,099 --> 01:17:55,230
I'm not.

858
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,705
Huh?

859
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:00,466
Baby, what the fuck
are you doing?

860
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:02,336
Fuck. Fuck!

861
01:18:03,504 --> 01:18:05,075
Jack!

862
01:18:06,078 --> 01:18:07,506
Holy, fuck.

863
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:12,720
Shit!

864
01:18:22,963 --> 01:18:25,227
Fuck! Fuck!

865
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:35,336
Yeah?

866
01:18:35,338 --> 01:18:36,436
<i>It's done.</i>

867
01:18:36,438 --> 01:18:38,141
<i>She was with Lou.</i>

868
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:59,393
<i>- Hello?
- - Hughey.</i>

869
01:19:00,066 --> 01:19:02,231
<i>Jackie.</i>

870
01:19:02,233 --> 01:19:04,530
<i>Mom said you ran away.
What's going on?</i>

871
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:06,807
Don't ever fall in love, okay.

872
01:19:08,338 --> 01:19:10,305
Okay, Hughey.
It hurts.

873
01:19:12,177 --> 01:19:14,045
Just don't ever fall in love.

874
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:15,409
<i>Hughey, who is it?</i>

875
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:17,312
<i>- Jackie.
- Give me the phone.</i>

876
01:19:17,314 --> 01:19:18,885
<i>Give me that.</i>

877
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,712
<i>Jacqueline, you stay away
from us, you monster!</i>

878
01:19:21,714 --> 01:19:23,615
<i>Don't ever call
this house again!</i>

879
01:19:35,365 --> 01:19:37,728
FBI, open up.

880
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,939
This is the FBI, Miss Langston.

881
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:51,016
Miss Langston,

882
01:19:51,018 --> 01:19:53,678
I need you to open the door now.

883
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,954
Jesus Christ.

884
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,717
Open the fucking door.

885
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:02,225
Hey. Hey, sorry,
one sec, uh...

886
01:20:03,195 --> 01:20:04,656
We just wanna talk.

887
01:20:08,002 --> 01:20:10,134
- Hey.
- You gonna let us in?

888
01:20:10,136 --> 01:20:12,070
You didn't really catch me
at the greatest time.

889
01:20:13,304 --> 01:20:14,600
It's about your brother-in-law.

890
01:20:16,802 --> 01:20:18,076
We really need to talk to you.

891
01:20:19,475 --> 01:20:20,639
We won't take long.

892
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,054
Nice place.

893
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,373
You talked to your dad recently?

894
01:20:52,673 --> 01:20:54,046
I told you, we don't talk.

895
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,312
Is that right?

896
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,622
When your brother-in-law's
remains were recovered,

897
01:21:09,624 --> 01:21:11,228
forensics also found these.

898
01:21:12,528 --> 01:21:14,660
We suspect they're people
who threatened your dad

899
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:16,299
and his operation.

900
01:21:16,301 --> 01:21:17,597
We've been trying
to shut him down

901
01:21:17,599 --> 01:21:18,664
for a while now.

902
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,468
But as soon as someone
starts talking,

903
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:22,943
they have a habit
of disappearing.

904
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,637
Your brother-in-law was
the latest.

905
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,574
Real shame what happened to him.

906
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,511
Lost us our best informant.

907
01:21:34,286 --> 01:21:36,484
Guess your dad caught wind, huh?

908
01:21:36,486 --> 01:21:38,651
I'm not involved
in any of his shit.

909
01:21:38,653 --> 01:21:40,686
But you were, weren't you?

910
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:44,426
Quite the sidekick,
we were told.

911
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:50,762
We've been trying to locate
your mom for a while now.

912
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,831
Wanted to ask her
what she remembers.

913
01:21:55,736 --> 01:21:56,867
The last record we could find

914
01:21:56,869 --> 01:21:58,572
was from 12 years ago.

915
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,839
It says she contacted
local police saying

916
01:22:01,841 --> 01:22:03,761
that she wanted to talk
to 'em about her husband.

917
01:22:05,647 --> 01:22:06,745
She never followed up.

918
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:09,055
Um...

919
01:23:01,175 --> 01:23:02,702
Hmm.

920
01:23:02,704 --> 01:23:03,967
<i>The bullshit stops</i>

921
01:23:03,969 --> 01:23:05,012
<i>now, Louise.</i>

922
01:23:06,444 --> 01:23:09,742
<i>Now you just listen up
and do exactly as I tell you.</i>

923
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,944
<i>- You ready?</i>
- I... Pfft... Huh?

924
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:16,518
I removed the witness
connecting you to JJ.

925
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,058
I protected you.

926
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,786
<i>Not that I'm dumb enough
to expect gratitude for it.</i>

927
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:21,985
You made her do that.

928
01:23:21,987 --> 01:23:23,822
Well, she was
in a tight spot last night.

929
01:23:23,824 --> 01:23:25,131
You should've helped her out.

930
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:33,073
- Where is she?
- I have her.

931
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:34,536
She'll be arrested
for double homicide,

932
01:23:34,538 --> 01:23:36,307
and this whole mess
will blow over.

933
01:23:36,309 --> 01:23:37,902
<i>The cops are gonna</i>

934
01:23:37,904 --> 01:23:39,112
<i>wanna talk to you.</i>

935
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,443
<i>Just tell them
you guys were having</i>

936
01:23:40,445 --> 01:23:41,675
<i>some fun together,
you're horrified...</i>

937
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:43,050
If you hurt her,
I'm gonna kill you.

938
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:44,876
<i>Lou,
shut the hell up, and listen.</i>

939
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:46,713
<i>Unless you wanna answer
for that dead body</i>

940
01:23:46,715 --> 01:23:48,583
<i>- in your apartment.</i>
- Ugh!

941
01:23:48,585 --> 01:23:52,488
I need you to sit tight
and do absolutely nothing.

942
01:23:53,986 --> 01:23:56,294
I know you can manage that.

943
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:57,658
<i>Just sit back.
Let Dad take care</i>

944
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:58,824
<i>of everything.</i>

945
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,859
<i>No fucking way.</i>

946
01:24:00,861 --> 01:24:02,465
What did you think
was gonna happen, Lou?

947
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:04,434
I'd be arrested
for a murder I didn't commit.

948
01:24:04,436 --> 01:24:05,836
What did you think
was gonna happen?

949
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,374
How many people are
down there, huh?

950
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:11,870
<i>Seemed like a lot in those days.</i>

951
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:13,443
<i>Did you keep it up?</i>

952
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:15,313
No one can connect me to bones.

953
01:24:15,711 --> 01:24:16,743
I can.

954
01:24:18,813 --> 01:24:20,351
Are you threatening me?

955
01:24:28,889 --> 01:24:29,954
Yep.

956
01:24:31,892 --> 01:24:33,397
Yeah, let her go
or I'm gonna call

957
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:34,662
the Feds right now,
and tell them

958
01:24:34,664 --> 01:24:36,504
everything you ever did.
How's that sound, Dad?

959
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:38,897
Hmm?

960
01:24:40,032 --> 01:24:41,966
Dad?

961
01:24:41,968 --> 01:24:43,803
<i>That was really stupid, honey.</i>

962
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,821
<i>Lou. Lou, are you there?</i>

963
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:36,988
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

964
01:25:37,694 --> 01:25:38,858
<i>Please come and get me.</i>

965
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,361
Lou!

966
01:26:21,936 --> 01:26:23,100
He sent you to kill me?

967
01:26:23,102 --> 01:26:24,310
Fuck you, you rat!

968
01:26:47,962 --> 01:26:49,995
Oh, God!

969
01:27:37,913 --> 01:27:40,012
Just get in the car.

970
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:42,916
Hey, Sharon.

971
01:27:42,918 --> 01:27:44,753
Just ruining everything.

972
01:27:46,691 --> 01:27:48,251
Oh!

973
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,983
Jackie?

974
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:22,989
I'm sorry,

975
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:24,661
- I didn't pick you up.
- Don't.

976
01:28:26,962 --> 01:28:29,061
I don't... I don't know
what he told you.

977
01:28:29,063 --> 01:28:31,932
Lou, he was my husband.

978
01:28:31,934 --> 01:28:33,835
I know.

979
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:37,476
And I'm... I'm sorry, but...

980
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:41,744
I... I'm... I'm not sorry.

981
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:48,751
- What the fuck, Lou?
- I just...

982
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:51,149
What the fuck? Why?

983
01:28:56,794 --> 01:28:58,288
Why?

984
01:28:59,731 --> 01:29:01,211
Because he was
gonna kill you one day.

985
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:06,736
You... don't know
anything about love.

986
01:29:08,036 --> 01:29:09,508
I'm so sorry for you.

987
01:29:10,269 --> 01:29:13,974
I love... you. I love you.

988
01:29:13,976 --> 01:29:15,107
Fuck off.

989
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:22,521
Wow.

990
01:29:23,623 --> 01:29:24,721
You're a...

991
01:29:26,824 --> 01:29:28,956
moron.

992
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,463
Where are...
Where are they?

993
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:32,531
Daddy's not here.

994
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:35,325
Really?

995
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:37,701
Where is she Beth?

996
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:39,835
- I don't know.
- Bethany!

997
01:29:39,837 --> 01:29:42,233
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

998
01:29:42,235 --> 01:29:43,641
You wanna tell me where she is?

999
01:29:43,643 --> 01:29:44,708
- Ow!
- Huh?

1000
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:45,808
Do you wanna be honest?

1001
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:47,040
Do you wanna be honest with me?

1002
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:48,910
Stop! Stop!

1003
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:51,583
- Where is she?
- Fucking monster.

1004
01:29:53,422 --> 01:29:55,620
- In the corn house.
- Love you, sis!

1005
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,349
Jack!

1006
01:30:02,288 --> 01:30:03,529
Jackie.

1007
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:06,829
Oh, no!

1008
01:30:07,326 --> 01:30:08,402
Oh, my God.

1009
01:30:09,064 --> 01:30:11,361
Just... Just one second.

1010
01:30:11,363 --> 01:30:12,637
Sorry,

1011
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,166
my family's so fucked!

1012
01:30:16,841 --> 01:30:18,643
I got you, I got you.
Hold on, baby.

1013
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:22,042
Ow!

1014
01:30:23,045 --> 01:30:24,649
What are you doing?

1015
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:26,552
Hey! Hey!

1016
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:30,380
- Hey, I'm trying to...
- Fuck!

1017
01:30:30,382 --> 01:30:32,217
- Hey, come here.
- Get off of me.

1018
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,054
- Oh, God. Hey...
- Let me go!

1019
01:30:34,056 --> 01:30:36,089
I'm helping you.

1020
01:30:39,358 --> 01:30:42,029
- Oh! Baby, what the fuck?
- You're selling me out?

1021
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,867
How am I selling you out?

1022
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:46,737
I... I love you.

1023
01:30:47,938 --> 01:30:49,542
Don't lie to me.

1024
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,236
- No, I'm not.
- No, you couldn't wait

1025
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,304
one night before you fucked
someone else!

1026
01:30:53,306 --> 01:30:55,878
Daisy? I did that for you.
She was gonna tell.

1027
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,176
Oh!

1028
01:30:57,178 --> 01:30:59,112
- You want me to thank you?
- No, I'm...

1029
01:30:59,114 --> 01:31:01,719
Baby, I'm just saying
it wasn't like that.

1030
01:31:01,721 --> 01:31:03,017
If I was selling you out,

1031
01:31:03,019 --> 01:31:04,348
I'd be telling the cops
everything right now.

1032
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:06,251
I'm not! I've got
Daisy's body in my truck.

1033
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:08,286
I was gonna get rid of it
before anyone found out.

1034
01:31:08,288 --> 01:31:11,025
I mean, Christ, I am...
I am really trying...

1035
01:31:11,027 --> 01:31:12,422
Oh, fuck!

1036
01:31:12,424 --> 01:31:14,424
I wish I never met you.

1037
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,750
I killed people, Lou.

1038
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:35,918
I know.

1039
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:39,053
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1040
01:31:42,828 --> 01:31:43,959
Hey...

1041
01:31:45,226 --> 01:31:47,490
There is absolutely nothing...

1042
01:31:47,492 --> 01:31:49,096
wrong with you.

1043
01:31:51,364 --> 01:31:52,935
You are the most amazing,
most incredible,

1044
01:31:52,937 --> 01:31:54,970
beautiful person I've ever met
in my whole life.

1045
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:02,813
He deserved it.

1046
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:05,750
What about her?

1047
01:32:08,117 --> 01:32:09,314
My dad made you do it.

1048
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,120
He does that.

1049
01:32:13,122 --> 01:32:14,362
You didn't have a choice, okay?

1050
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:18,059
I fucking love you, you idiot.

1051
01:32:21,262 --> 01:32:22,426
I love you too.

1052
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:36,979
What's gonna happen to us?

1053
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:38,915
You're gonna be okay.

1054
01:32:40,512 --> 01:32:42,556
You just have to listen
to me this time, you got it?

1055
01:32:42,987 --> 01:32:44,052
Can you do that?

1056
01:32:44,857 --> 01:32:45,988
Okay.

1057
01:32:50,863 --> 01:32:51,928
Hmm.

1058
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:00,937
Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

1059
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,237
You go that way,
there's a back road.

1060
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:05,502
Wait for me there.

1061
01:33:05,504 --> 01:33:07,174
Stay out of sight.
Make sure no one sees you.

1062
01:33:07,176 --> 01:33:08,714
What about you?

1063
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:10,474
I'll be fine. There's
something I gotta do first.

1064
01:33:10,476 --> 01:33:11,849
Feds are gonna be
here in two minutes.

1065
01:33:11,851 --> 01:33:13,818
Get the fuck out of here. Go!

1066
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:28,393
Dad?
Where the fuck are you?

1067
01:33:29,429 --> 01:33:30,736
Hey!

1068
01:33:33,466 --> 01:33:35,708
Ow! Ah!

1069
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:38,975
Drop it.

1070
01:33:38,977 --> 01:33:40,405
You ungrateful brat.

1071
01:33:44,246 --> 01:33:45,311
God. Well...

1072
01:33:46,215 --> 01:33:47,280
It's over, man.

1073
01:33:48,052 --> 01:33:50,019
I told them everything.

1074
01:33:50,021 --> 01:33:51,614
You have no idea
what you've done.

1075
01:33:51,616 --> 01:33:53,220
Uh, yes, I do.

1076
01:33:53,222 --> 01:33:54,892
I've done the right thing
for the first time

1077
01:33:54,894 --> 01:33:56,795
- in my whole life, Dad.
- Oh, Jesus.

1078
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,929
- You sound like your mother.
- Shut up!

1079
01:34:00,559 --> 01:34:02,130
You killed her, didn't you?

1080
01:34:02,132 --> 01:34:03,901
I get it. She was gonna tell.

1081
01:34:03,903 --> 01:34:05,496
I just wanna know.
Did you do it yourself,

1082
01:34:05,498 --> 01:34:06,739
or did you have Mike do it?

1083
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:08,268
Your mom left
because she couldn't

1084
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:09,808
stand being a wife to me,

1085
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,744
and a mother to you.

1086
01:34:12,307 --> 01:34:13,977
You fucking liar.

1087
01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:16,639
I'm nothing like you.

1088
01:34:16,641 --> 01:34:18,311
That'd be nice wouldn't it?

1089
01:34:18,313 --> 01:34:19,411
Stop lying.

1090
01:34:19,853 --> 01:34:20,984
Oh...

1091
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,826
Let go of me!

1092
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:45,107
It's okay.

1093
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:46,339
Come on.

1094
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:47,813
- It's okay.
- Dad...

1095
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:50,409
Everyone learns the hard way.

1096
01:34:50,411 --> 01:34:52,642
It's the ones you love
the most that always

1097
01:34:52,644 --> 01:34:54,611
disappoint you in the end.

1098
01:34:54,613 --> 01:34:56,349
Get off her!

1099
01:34:59,321 --> 01:35:00,617
What the fuck?

1100
01:35:05,657 --> 01:35:06,997
Oh, wow!

1101
01:35:26,084 --> 01:35:27,380
Lou, help me.

1102
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:38,160
You know what?

1103
01:35:38,162 --> 01:35:39,524
I love you, too.

1104
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,462
You sick fuck!

1105
01:35:43,464 --> 01:35:45,035
They're coming.
Just finish it.

1106
01:35:45,037 --> 01:35:47,565
- No.
- Come on.

1107
01:35:53,573 --> 01:35:54,671
Bye, Dad.
